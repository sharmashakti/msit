# Proximity Monitor
The proximity monitor application is listening for **ProximityDetected** events. This is just to illustrate how to create a monitor for an event stream emitted by your event processor. As you'll read in the book, you can have multiple event processors, multiple outbound streams, and multiple monitors. How you design it depends largely on your expected volume and the domain of your application.
